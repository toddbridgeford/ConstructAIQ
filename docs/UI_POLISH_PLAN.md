# UI Polish Plan

**Status:** Shell — Phase 24  
**Branch:** `claude/cleanup-launch-docs-eXjy2`  
**Source audits:** `docs/UX_HEURISTICS_AUDIT.md` · `docs/GSTACK_DESIGN_AUDIT.md`  
**Note:** `.claude/skills/taste-SKILL.md` was not found in this repository. This plan uses the design parameters and audit findings provided in the task brief.

## Purpose

Convert the UX and GSTACK audits into controlled polish work without random redesign or unsupported claims.

## Design Parameters by Surface

| Surface | DESIGN_VARIANCE | MOTION_INTENSITY | VISUAL_DENSITY |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Homepage | 6 | 3 | 4 |
| Dashboard | 4 | 2 | 7 |
| Trust / Status | 4 | 2 | 5 |

**Parameter definitions:**

- **DESIGN_VARIANCE (1–10):** How far individual components may deviate from the established pattern. 4 = tight consistency; 6 = deliberate accent differentiation permitted on one element per section.
- **MOTION_INTENSITY (1–10):** Maximum animation expressiveness allowed. 2 = functional transitions only (opacity/height); 3 = one entrance animation per page section maximum.
- **VISUAL_DENSITY (1–10):** Target information density. 4 = spacious/marketing; 7 = professional dense data; 5 = balanced prose + data.

**Aesthetic direction per surface:**

- **Homepage:** Asymmetric, data-led — one live chart dominates the above-the-fold space, sections breathe at spacious rhythm, and the single permitted design accent per section (DESIGN_VARIANCE 6) is used to differentiate the "Free Forever" claim from surrounding trust cards.
- **Dashboard:** Tight, information-dense, and consistent — every component follows the canonical token set with no decorative deviation; motion is limited to functional state transitions (skeleton → data, section entry fade) and never decorative; density targets a professional operator who reads six KPI values before scrolling.
- **Trust / Status:** Prose-first, navigable, and neutral — layout serves readability of long-form methodology documentation and live pipeline status tables; the only permitted motion is a fade-in on section entry; density sits between marketing and data, with generous line-height and clear section breaks compensating for information depth.

## Typography Direction

### Typeface rules

- **Primary voice:** `font.sys` (`'Aeonik Pro', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif`) is the only typeface for headings, body copy, navigation, card titles, marketing copy, and section eyebrows. Aeonik Pro is not yet loaded — see GSTACK Priority Fix #2. Until font files are added, the system fallback renders, which is acceptable temporarily but not production-ready.
- **Mono accent:** `font.mono` (`ui-monospace, 'SF Mono', 'Cascadia Code', Consolas, monospace`) is used exclusively for: numeric KPI values, series IDs (e.g. `TTLCONS`, `CES2000000001`), timestamps, as-of dates, API key strings, and status codes. It is not used for section eyebrows, card titles, page-level navigation, prose, or section labels that name content categories.
- **Do not** use Inter, Roboto, or Arial as the intentional typographic voice. The system fallback is a temporary concession — once Aeonik Pro loads it must displace the fallback, not coexist with it.

### All-caps label policy

`TS.label` (`fontSize:11, fontFamily:font.mono, letterSpacing:'0.08em', textTransform:'uppercase'`) is currently overused: 12 instances on one homepage scroll, 7 in Dashboard Overview. This flattens every section to equal visual weight.

**Permitted uses (two roles only):**
1. The label immediately above a numeric KPI value — e.g. `CONSTRUCTION SPENDING` above a dollar figure
2. A single section-type eyebrow that names the data category per page — one per section maximum

**Remove from:** card eyebrows inside trust/provenance cards, page-header brand labels (`CONSTRUCTAIQ` above H1 on all four audited pages), navigation items, and any label that names a prose section rather than a data category. Replace those with `type.h3` in `font.sys`.

### Type scale — token targets

All sizes and weights come from `src/lib/theme.ts`. Never set `fontSize` or `fontWeight` inline outside the token system.

| Role | Token | Size | Family | Weight | Usage |
|------|-------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| H1 / display | `type.h1` | 28px | `font.sys` | 700 | Page title — one per page |
| Section heading | `type.h2` | 22px | `font.sys` | 600 | Major section break |
| Subsection / card title | `type.h3` | 17px | `font.sys` | 600 | Card headings, section eyebrows that name prose sections |
| Body | `type.body` | 15px | `font.sys` | 400 | All prose, descriptions, tooltip text |
| KPI hero value | `type.kpi` | 48px | `font.mono` | 700 | Primary metric — one per section |
| KPI secondary value | `type.kpiSm` | 32px | `font.mono` | 700 | Supporting metrics |
| Data label | `type.label` | 11px | `font.mono` | 500 | Label above a KPI value only — uppercase, tracked |
| Inline data value | `type.data` | 14px | `font.mono` | 400 | Table cells, feed rows, timestamps |
| Caption / source metadata | `type.caption` | 12px | `font.sys` | 400 | Source attribution, as-of date, caveat lines |

**Minimum legibility floor:** No informational text below 11px. Current violations — `fontSize:9` in `DataTrustBadge.tsx:119` and `fontSize:9` in `OverviewSection.tsx:172,232` — fail WCAG AA (≈3.5:1 on dark backgrounds). Raise all to 11px minimum as part of this polish pass.

### Per-surface direction

- **Homepage (DESIGN_VARIANCE 6):** H1 at `type.h1` in `font.sys`; hero spending KPI at `type.kpi` in `font.mono`; section eyebrows replaced with `type.h3` wherever they name a prose category rather than a data series. The display hierarchy should be legible in three levels: H1 → section heading → body. No fourth tier of MONO all-caps labels competing for attention.
- **Dashboard (DESIGN_VARIANCE 4):** KPI values at `type.kpi` / `type.kpiSm`; data labels at `type.label` (above numeric only); table cells and feed rows at `type.data`. No decorative typographic variation — every component uses the same token for the same role. Section headings at `type.h2`.
- **Trust / Status (DESIGN_VARIANCE 4):** Body at `type.body` with `lineHeight:1.6` for long-form readability. Section headings at `type.h2`. Table column headers at `type.label` (11px) — raise from current 11px `#555` which fails contrast on light backgrounds. Caption / source metadata at `type.caption`. No MONO outside table cells, status labels, and timestamps.

## Color and Semantic Token Direction

### Palette source of truth

All colors come from `src/lib/theme.ts` → `color.*` and `signal.*`. No component file may declare a raw hex string. The current violation count: `/trust/page.tsx` has 12 hardcoded hex strings (`'#333'`, `'#111'`, `'#f5f5f5'`, `'#555'`, `'#aaa'`, etc.) with no `color.*` import — this is the highest-priority token compliance fix on the Trust surface.

### Semantic signal system

Each hue carries exactly one meaning. Using the same color for two different signals destroys the communication value of the palette.

| Hue | `theme.ts` token | Semantic meaning | Forbidden uses |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Amber** `#f5a623` | `color.amber` / `signal.watch` | Primary data value accent — headline metric, Verdict WATCH state | Do not use as a general warning; do not use for CTA buttons |
| **Blue** `#0a84ff` | `color.blue` | Forecast projections, confidence bands, CTAs, selected state, links | Do not use as a positive/healthy signal; do not double as a warning |
| **Green** `#30d158` | `color.green` / `signal.expand` | Expansion, positive direction, fresh data, healthy pipeline | Do not use decoratively; do not use for non-directional accents |
| **Red** `#ff453a` | `color.red` / `signal.contract` | Contraction, risk, failed pipeline, stale data | Do not use for anything other than negative signals |
| **Gray** `t3` `#a0a0ab` / `t4` `#6e6e73` | `color.t3`, `color.t4` | Context, metadata, source attribution, timestamps, secondary labels | Do not use as a primary text color; minimum 11px at this weight |
| **Federal** `#0066CC` | `signal.federal` | Federal infrastructure data specifically — IIJA/IRA program context | Do not use as a generic blue; reserve for federal data surfaces |

**Amber conflict to resolve:** `color.amber` is currently used both as the KPI headline accent (construction spending) and as the `signal.watch` state (market condition). These are compatible uses — amber = "primary attention metric" — but the Sidebar newsletter CTA also uses `color.amber` for "Subscribe," which places a commercial action in the same color as market warning signals. Move the CTA accent to `color.blue` to separate commercial and analytical uses.

### Gradient policy

Decorative gradients are prohibited unless the gradient encodes data meaning (e.g. a heatmap scale, a confidence band fill).

**Currently violating:**

| Pattern | File | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| `.grad-text` — gradient headline text | `src/app/globals.css:200` · `src/app/components/HeroSection.tsx:143` | Remove `.grad-text`; replace with `color.t1` (white) or `color.amber` solid |
| `.btn-fl` glow shadow at rest | `src/app/globals.css:129–138` | Remove `box-shadow` at rest; hover = background color change only, no `translateY`, no amplified shadow |
| `.btn-g` glassmorphism | `src/app/globals.css:151–158` | Remove `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)`; replace with `color.bg2` solid background |
| Hero background triple radial-gradient | `src/app/globals.css:186–189` | Subtle enough to retain — three radial glows at 5–13% opacity qualify as texture, not decoration. Keep but do not add more. |

**Rule:** One decorative background gradient maximum per surface, at opacity ≤ 15%. Gradient text on headlines is prohibited unconditionally — it is the single most-recognized AI-generated landing page pattern.

### Semantic token map

The following table maps each semantic role to its `theme.ts` source token. Use the semantic name in documentation and design discussion; use the `theme.ts` token in code.

| Semantic token | `theme.ts` value | Hex | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------|-----|-------|
| `bg` | `color.bg0` | `#000` | Page background — dark surfaces |
| `surface` | `color.bg1` / `color.bg2` | `#0d0d0d` / `#1a1a1a` | Card and panel backgrounds |
| `border` | `color.bd1` / `color.bd2` | `#2a2a2a` / `#383838` | Card borders / table dividers |
| `text-primary` | `color.t1` | `#fff` | Headings, KPI values, primary body |
| `text-secondary` | `color.t2` | `#ebebf0` | Subheadings, card titles |
| `text-muted` | `color.t3` | `#a0a0ab` | Source attribution, timestamps, secondary labels |
| `text-disabled` | `color.t4` | `#6e6e73` | Placeholder text, inactive states — minimum 11px |
| `accent-primary` | `color.blue` | `#0a84ff` | CTAs, links, forecast lines, selected state |
| `status-fresh` | `color.green` | `#30d158` | Fresh data, healthy pipeline, expansion signal |
| `status-warning` | `color.amber` | `#f5a623` | Delayed data, WATCH market condition |
| `status-risk` | `color.red` | `#ff453a` | Failed pipeline, stale data, CONTRACTING signal |
| `forecast` | `color.blue` | `#0a84ff` | Forecast line, confidence band stroke — same as `accent-primary`; confidence band fill uses `color.blueDim` (`#001a3d`) |

### `color.purple` — phantom token

`color.purple` (`#5e5ce6`) has one use: `OverviewSection.tsx:403` as the CSHI Score KPI accent. It has no entry in `signal.*` and no documented semantic meaning. **Resolution required before polish pass:**

- Option A: Add `signal.composite: color.purple` to `theme.ts` with a comment — "Composite index accent; used only for CSHI Score KPI."
- Option B: Replace with `color.blue` and remove the purple differentiation.

Do not leave an undocumented accent color in the token system. It will propagate.

### Light-surface exception (Trust Center)

`/trust/page.tsx` renders on a white background (`#ffffff`). The dark-theme `color.*` tokens (`color.t1 = #fff`) are not usable directly. The light-surface palette must use:

| Role | Value | `theme.ts` source |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Page background | `color.lightBg` | `#f8f8f8` |
| Card background | `color.lightBgAlt` | `#fafafa` |
| Border | `color.lightBd` | `#e5e5e5` |
| Primary text | `#111111` | No current token — map to a new `color.lightT1` or use inline as a documented exception |
| Secondary text | `#555555` | No current token — map to `color.lightT2` |

The immediate fix is to import `color` from `theme.ts` and use the `lightBg*` and `lightBd` tokens that already exist. The two missing light text tokens (`lightT1`, `lightT2`) should be added to `theme.ts` in the same pass rather than leaving raw hex strings in the component.

## Verdict

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Build | **GO** — `✓ Compiled successfully` · 84 routes · 0 errors (94.6 s) |
| Lint | **GO** — `✔ No ESLint warnings or errors` |
| Tests | **GO** — 23 files · 317/317 passed |
| Smoke | **NO-GO** — `smoke:prod` exit 1 · `smoke:www` exit 1 |
| Public launch | **NO-GO** — sole blocker: Vercel domain binding (see below) |

---

## P0 blocker

Vercel does not recognise `constructaiq.trade` or `www.constructaiq.trade`.
Every inbound request is rejected at the edge (`x-deny-reason: host_not_allowed`)
before the Next.js app runs. DNS is correct. No code change is needed.

---

## Next action — do this now

**Vercel UI → ConstructAIQ project → Settings → Domains**

1. **Add Domain** → `constructaiq.trade` → confirm.
2. **Add Domain** → `www.constructaiq.trade` → confirm.
3. Wait for a green checkmark on both (SSL provisions in 1–10 minutes).

Step-by-step walkthrough: [docs/VERCEL_DOMAIN_FIX.md](./VERCEL_DOMAIN_FIX.md)

## Verify — run these after binding

```bash
curl -sSI https://constructaiq.trade
curl -sSI https://www.constructaiq.trade/dashboard
npm run smoke:www
npm run smoke:prod
```

**Pass state:**
- `curl -sSI https://constructaiq.trade` returns `HTTP/2 200` (or a valid canonical redirect) — no `x-deny-reason` header.
- `curl -sSI https://www.constructaiq.trade/dashboard` returns `HTTP/2 301`, `302`, or `308` with a `location` header pointing to `https://constructaiq.trade/dashboard` — no `x-deny-reason` header.
- `npm run smoke:www` exits 0 and prints `✓ All checks passed`.
- `npm run smoke:prod` exits 0 and prints `✓ All checks passed`.

If all four pass, the P0 is resolved. Update the verdict to **GO** and proceed
with env-variable verification (see [OPERATOR_HANDOFF.md](./OPERATOR_HANDOFF.md)).

## Last verified — 2026-04-25 18:55 UTC (`npm run launch:check -- --include-smoke`)

| Gate | Command | Exit | Result |
|------|---------|------|--------|
| 5 | `npm run build` | **0** | `✓ Compiled successfully in 56 s` · 84 routes · 0 errors |
| 5 | `npm run lint` | **0** | `✔ No ESLint warnings or errors` |
| 5 | `npm test` | **0** | 23 files · 317/317 tests passed |
| 4 | `npm run smoke:prod` | **1** | 1 passed, 5 failed — `x-deny-reason: host_not_allowed` |
| 4 | `npm run smoke:www` | **1** | 1 passed, 1 failed — `x-deny-reason: host_not_allowed` |

`launch:check` summary line: `✗ Launch readiness FAILED — smoke gates: smoke:prod, smoke:www`
`launch:check` exit code: **1**

DNS resolves on both domains (`www DNS resolves` passes on both smoke runs).
The Vercel domain binding has not been completed.

Env/data verification (Supabase, CRON_SECRET, federal source, weekly-brief
source) was not attempted — all endpoints return HTTP 403 before the
application runs, so those probes carry no signal. They will be run once
smoke exits 0.
